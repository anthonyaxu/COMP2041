24/9/18     21:20       21:50       Coding          Implemented init command and usage print statements.

24/9/18     22:00       22:50       Coding          Implemented most of add command. Added file_exists and 
                                                    copy_files subroutines to legit.pl.
                                                    
24/8/18     22:50       23:00       Debugging/      Forgot to add .index and .commits sub-directories inside .legit
                                    Refactoring     Wrote comments to make functions and code more clear.
                                             
24/9/18     23:00       01:00       Coding          Completed most of the '-m' commit, needs more testing. Added
                                                    initialise_commits, commit_files, is_folder_empty, clean_index, 
                                                    and commit usage subroutines.
                                                    
25/9/18     11:00       12:00       Coding/         Finished commit part but then found some bugs in it (not checking
                                    Debugging       the previous commit to see if the files were unchanged). Added 
                                                    check_unchanged, write_commit_message and is_file_same.
                                                    
25/9/18     13:00       15:00       Coding          Completed 'log' part and started on 'show' part. Added print_file, 
                                                    and add_to log. Used the model legit (on cse servers) to test some
                                                    edge cases for show.
                                                    
25/9/18     16:00       21:00       Debugging       Modified commit_files subroutine because there were a lot of errors/
                                                    doing the wrong thing when commiting things. Changed how the add 
                                                    function and the index directory works.
                                                    
25/9/18     21:30       22:30       Coding          Finished with subset0 (passing all autotests). Will do further 
                                                    testing on functionality and edge cases after code is refactored. 
                                                    
25/9/18     23:00       00:00       Testing         Running my own test scripts on the commands in subset0.
                                                    
26/9/18     12:00       13:00       Coding          Started on first part of subset1 (-a commit). Had to refactor some lines
                                                    of the initial commit to make the '-a' flag work.
                                                    
26/9/18     15:00       16:30       Debugging       Realised that the '-a' flag can be after the message and not only before
                                                    the -m flag. Also realised that multiple -m flags can be used and only the
                                                    message for the last -m will count.
                                                    
26/9/18     19:00       21:30       Refactoring     Made check_unchanged less specific. i.e. it can take in any files and
                                                    compare it to the previous commit. Before it could only compare 
                                                    the index and the previous commit.
                                                    
27/9/18     13:00       16:00       Coding          Started working on the 'rm' command of legit.pl. Realised that tags can be
                                                    anywhere and appear more than once. Added remove_file subroutine. 
                                                    
27/9/18     16:30       17:30       Debugging       Found some errors/bugs with the add command after most of rm command was
                                                    implemented. eg. legit.pl needs to know if the added file has been 
                                                    deleted or was never in the directory. 
                                                    
27/9/18     20:00       22:00       Coding          Mostly completed the first two tasks of subset1 (-a and rm). Need to
                                                    do more tests on edge cases (what type of error messages to print, etc).
                                                    Passes all autotests until subset1_15.
                                                    
28/9/18     16:00       19:00       Debugging       Fixed 'rm' command, problem with the flags. Also using test_legit.pl
                                                    to compare my legit.pl to the reference implementation.
                       
30/9/18     15:00       17:00       Debugging       Fixed multiple printing errors (when legit.pl doesn't recognise command
                                                    and when no command is input).
                                                    
30/9/18     19:00       20:00       Testing         Running my own test scripts on the commands in subset1.

1/10/18     17:00       18:00       Refactoring     Refactored code and added some more comments to make code more readable.

2/10/18     15:00       16:00       Refactoring     Move error prints into subroutubes, easier to keep track of them.
                                                    Also added more comments.
                                                    
3/10/18     18:00       20:00       Debugging/      Add some more comments to code to make it easier to follow. 
                                    Refactoring     Modified some test scripts to test more functionality of 'rm' command
